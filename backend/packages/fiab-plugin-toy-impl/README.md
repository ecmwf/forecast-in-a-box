This is a toy plugin example -- take an inspiration here when writing your own plugin.

This is the implementation part of the plugin: the functions that run inside the cascade worker runtime and do the heavy lifting data operations.

Consult the main readme of [forecast-in-a-box](../../README.md), and documentation of [plugins](../../docs/plugins.md).
