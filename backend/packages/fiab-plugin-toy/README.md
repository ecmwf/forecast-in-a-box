This is a toy plugin example -- take an inspiration here when writing your own plugin.

This is the definition part of the plugin -- here we specify which products and data sources the plugin exposes and refer to the functions they execute internally, but we don't actually implement those functions, thats in the `fiab-plugin-toy-impl` wheel.

Consult the main readme of [forecast-in-a-box](../../README.md), and documentation of [plugins](../../docs/plugins.md).
