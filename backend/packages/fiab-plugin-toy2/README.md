This is a toy plugin example -- take an inspiration here when writing your own plugin.

Content-wise it is identical to fiab-toy-plugin which consists of two wheels ([catalogue part](../fiab-plugin-toy) and [runtime part](../fiab-plugin-toy-impl).
But it differs in organization as it is a single wheel, with the runtime part dependencies being an extra.

Consult the main readme of [forecast-in-a-box](../../README.md), and documentation of [plugins](../../docs/plugins.md).
