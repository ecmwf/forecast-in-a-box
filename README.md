Forecast-In-A-Box is a prototype AI solution concept piloted by ECMWF, through an effort jointly funded by [Destination Earth](https://destination-earth.eu/) and ECMWF core activities. It showcases a way to containerize and package complete AI-based forecasting pipelines, bringing together ECMWF’s open-source software and AI models — such as ANEMOI, EarthKit, AIFS, PProc and other components of the ECMWF stack — to cover all stages of the forecasting process, from using data inputs from ECMWF’s analyses to the execution of AI models, post-processing, and visualization.

It allows to run any model that subscribes to the Anemoi-Inference interface.
